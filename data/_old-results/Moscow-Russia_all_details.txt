Ana's testimony highlights the academic support she received, her integration into the cultural fabric of Moscow, and her ongoing contributions to bridging Russian-Brazilian relations through her research and teaching. Her story is a testament to the academic opportunities and personal growth that Moscow universities can offer to international students from South America.",
