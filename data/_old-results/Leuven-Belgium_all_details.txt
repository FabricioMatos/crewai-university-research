      "An European student shared their frustrating experience while applying for a Chemistry Masters at KU Leuven on Reddit. The student faced delays and communication issues with the admissions office, which affected their decision-making process as they also had a conditional offer from the University of Edinburgh. The lengthy verification process and the slow response from the admissions team created a situation where the student felt unsupported and uncertain about their application's status.
