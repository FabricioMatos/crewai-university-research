      "Jaqueline Cassemiro from Brazil shared her experience at the University of Vienna's winter school. She described it as a fabulous opportunity to learn both inside and outside the classroom. The morning classes with excellent professors were complemented by afternoon excursions or free time to explore Vienna and its cultural offerings. She found it very rewarding to be in a city that breathes culture and is close to other European cities. This experience was one of the best in her life, providing her with invaluable learning and travel opportunities and a chance to meet people from around the world."
